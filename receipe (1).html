                <h3>Chicken Tikka Masala</h3>
                <p>To make Chicken Tikka Masala, start by marinating the chicken. Mix 1 cup of yogurt, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 2 teaspoons of ground cumin, 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper, 2 teaspoons of black pepper, 1 tablespoon of minced ginger, and 4 teaspoons of salt in a bowl. Add 3 boneless chicken breasts cut into pieces and coat well. Refrigerate for at least an hour. Preheat your grill to medium-high, thread the chicken onto skewers, and grill until cooked, about 5 minutes on each side. For the sauce, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan and sauté 1 minced garlic clove and 1 chopped jalapeno for 1 minute. Add 2 teaspoons of ground cumin, 2 teaspoons of paprika, and 3 teaspoons of salt. Stir in an 8-ounce can of tomato sauce and 1 cup of heavy cream, then simmer for 20 minutes until the sauce thickens. Add the grilled chicken to the sauce and simmer for another 10 minutes. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with rice or naan. Enjoy!</p>

                <p>To make Paneer Butter Masala, start by heating 2 tablespoons of butter in a pan over medium heat. Add 1 finely chopped onion and sauté until golden brown. Stir in 2 teaspoons of ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute. Add 3 large tomatoes, chopped, and cook until they turn soft and mushy.

Add 250 grams of paneer cubes and simmer for 5 minutes until the paneer is heated through and absorbs the flavors.

                <h3>Parotta</h3>
                <p>To make Parotta, start by mixing 3 cups of all-purpose flour (maida) and 1 teaspoon of salt in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add 1 cup of water (or as needed) and knead into a soft, smooth dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. Next, divide the dough into lemon-sized balls. Take one ball at a time, dust it with flour, and roll it out into a thin circle using a rolling pin. Brush the surface with ghee (clarified butter) and sprinkle some flour evenly. Starting from one end, pleat the dough to form a rope-like structure. Coil the pleated dough to form a round ball. Flatten the ball gently with your palm and roll it out again into a thin circle. Heat a tawa (griddle) over medium-high heat and place the rolled parotta on it. Cook each side until golden brown spots appear, brushing with ghee as needed. Repeat with the remaining dough balls. Serve hot with a side of vegetable kurma or any curry of your choice. Enjoy the flaky and delicious Parotta!</p>

                <h3>Kesari</h3>
                <p>To prepare Kesari, start by heating 1/2 cup of ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add 1/2 cup of cashews and fry them until they turn golden brown. Remove the cashews and set them aside. In the same pan, add 1 cup of rava (semolina) and roast it until it turns aromatic and lightly golden, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil along with a pinch of saffron strands (kesar). Once the rava is roasted, carefully pour the boiling saffron water into the pan, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Lower the heat and add 1 cup of sugar, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely. Continue cooking on low heat until the kesari thickens and begins to leave the sides of the pan. Add the fried cashews, 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom powder, and a few drops of rose water (optional) for flavor. Mix well and cook for another minute. Remove from heat and cover the pan for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Serve Kesari warm or at room temperature as a delightful dessert or sweet treat.</p>
